I am Haiwen Huang, my Chinese name is ÈªÑÊµ∑Êñá. I am a PhD student at University of T√ºbingen, co-supervised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/) and [Dr. Dan Zhang](https://www.bosch-ai.com/research/researcher-pages/t_overviewpage_133.html), starting in Jan. 2022. I am also an [ELLIS PhD student](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).

My PhD research focuses on **improving the generalization of vision and multimodal models**, enabling them to perform robustly across diverse tasks and domains. For example, I have developed methods that leverage 3D priors to enhance 2D object detection in [GOOD](https://openreview.net/forum?id=W-nZDQyuy8D) (ICLR2023) and use self-distillation to upsample features in Vision Foundation Models in [LoftUp](https://andrehuang.github.io/) (coming soon). I have also contributed to building more reliable evaluations of open-vocabulary generalization in [RENOVATE](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Uw2eJOI822&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Andreas%20Geiger%5D) (NeurIPS 2024).

I envision my work through a three-tiered ‚Äúresearch pyramid‚Äù: (1) Method Development, (2) Performance Evaluation, and (3) Normative Meta-Evaluation. My PhD projects focus on the first two levels, but my long-term goal is to address all three to ensure that AI truly benefits society.

üî¥ I am curently **seeking internships starting from Sept/Oct 2025 onward** where I can explore methods for understanding and evaluating the generalization and capabilities of VLMs, as well as the scientific principles behind designing robust benchmarks for them.

Before my PhD studies, I completed my MSc in CS at University of Oxford, advised by [Prof. Yarin Gal](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website/), and my undergrad study in Mathematics at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Bin Dong](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/). I have also worked as a researcher for a year at Megvii (previously known as Face++) with [Xinyu Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jv4LCj8AAAAJ&hl=en) as my group leader, studying large-scale annotation and OoD detection methods. 

My CV is [here](https://andrehuang.github.io/files/HaiwenHuang_CV.pdf).
